### Introduction

This package will take you to all of the things I ad created from the start of the term to the end. Overall the term wa great and is a great start to the three years I will be staying at Ravensbourne.

### Eye Bombing

The Eyebombing was a great idea to show us how to look at objects to see something else, in this case, faces within objects.

### Union Hack

I really enjoyed looking at flags and just how complex they are, the thought that goes behind creating a flag is incredible and this project really helped me see flags differently and helped me with how I design!

### One Tweet

This project was great as I had to work with Illustrator to create typographic posters for tweets.

### Code On Your Plate

I hadn't had any prior experience with HTML or CSS, this project allowed me to get a grasp of how to use HTML and CSS to make a design.

### CSS Tricks

I had to explain how people design things to make them look clickable, much like a button. I had gone and done my research and made it interesting by asking the audience what makes them click a button.
